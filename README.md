Stack data structure and associated operations

A stack is a basic data structure that can be logically thought as linear structure represented by a real physical stack or pile, a structure where insertion and deletion of items takes place at one end called top of the stack.

In other words, a 'Stack' is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements, with two principal operations: 'stackPush', which adds an element to the collection, and 'stackPop', which removes the most recently added element that was not yet removed.
